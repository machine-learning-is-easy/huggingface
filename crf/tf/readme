"CRF Decoding does not work with KerasTensors in TF2.4. The bug has since been fixed in tensorflow/tensorflow##45534"


labels:
crf need to calculate a kernel, which dimension is (num_labels, num_labels). if we use the massive labels like 30,000.
this kernel matrix would be 900,000,000 which is super large. an idea is reduce this labels to training tokens.
training tokens can bes several hundreds.
